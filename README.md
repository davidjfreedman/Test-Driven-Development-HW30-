HW30-Test-Driven Development (console only)
==========

**Project:** Create code which returns positive results for the tested elements.

**Description:** I love the whole concept of Test-Driven Development, of front-loading the QA as the code is being built up. I think it's an excellent way to work and ensure the code is properly functioning continuously.

**Why?:** Once the main tests were passed, I tried to play a little with it a little. When a human has no animal to feed and yet is put through the 'feed' function, I made it so some odd responses show up.

**Tech used:** Javascript, jQuery, HTML.

**Future Updates:** Nothing planned.
